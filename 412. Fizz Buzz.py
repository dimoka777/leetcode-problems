# Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

# answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
# answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
# answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
# answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.
Â 
# Example 1:
# Input: n = 3
# Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]

class Solution:
    def fizzBuzz(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        return ['FizzBuzz' if i % 5 == 0 and i % 3 == 0 else 'Fizz' if i % 3 == 0 else 'Buzz' if i % 5 == 0 else str(i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
