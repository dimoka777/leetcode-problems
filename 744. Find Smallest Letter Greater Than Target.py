# You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters.

# Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.

# Example 1:

# Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
# Output: "c"
# Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.



class Solution:
    def nextGreatestLetter(self, letters: List[str], target: str) -> str:
        left = 0
        right = len(letters) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if letters[mid] <= target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        
        if left == len(letters):
            return letters[0]
        else:
            return letters[left]
