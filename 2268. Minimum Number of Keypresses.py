# You have a keypad with 9 buttons, numbered from 1 to 9, each mapped to lowercase English letters. You can choose which characters each button is matched to as long as:

# All 26 lowercase English letters are mapped to.
# Each character is mapped to by exactly 1 button.
# Each button maps to at most 3 characters.


# To type the first character matched to a button, you press the button once. To type the second character, you press the button twice, and so on.

# Given a string s, return the minimum number of keypresses needed to type s using your keypad.

# Note that the characters mapped to by each button, and the order they are mapped in cannot be changed.

Â 
# Example 1:

# Input: s = "apple"
# Output: 5
# Explanation: One optimal way to setup your keypad is shown above.
# Type 'a' by pressing button 1 once.
# Type 'p' by pressing button 6 once.
# Type 'p' by pressing button 6 once.
# Type 'l' by pressing button 5 once.
# Type 'e' by pressing button 3 once.
# A total of 5 button presses are needed, so return 5.
