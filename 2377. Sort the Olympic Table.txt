# medals it won in the Olympic games.

# The Olympic table is sorted according to the following rules:
#
# The country with more gold medals comes first.
# If there is a tie in the gold medals, the country with more silver medals comes first.
# If there is a tie in the silver medals, the country with more bronze medals comes first.
# If there is a tie in the bronze medals, the countries with the tie are sorted in ascending order lexicographically.
# Write an SQL query to sort the Olympic table
#
# The query result format is shown in the following example.
