# Given the head of a linked list, find all the values that appear more than once in the list and delete the nodes that have any of those values.

# Return the linked list after the deletions.

Â 
# Example 1:

# Input: head = [1,2,3,2]
# Output: [1,3]
# Explanation: 2 appears twice in the linked list, so all 2's should be deleted. After deleting all 2's, we are left with [1,3].
