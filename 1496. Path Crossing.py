# Amazon
# Given a string path, where path[i] = 'N', 'S', 'E' or 'W', each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. 
# You start at the origin (0, 0) on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by path.

# Return true if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you have previously visited. Return false otherwise.

Â 
# Example 1:

# Input: path = "NES"
# Output: false 
# Explanation: Notice that the path doesn't cross any point more than once.
