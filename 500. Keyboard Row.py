# Given an array of strings words, return the words that can be typed using letters 
# of the alphabet on only one row of American keyboard like the image below.

# In the American keyboard:

# the first row consists of the characters "qwertyuiop",
# the second row consists of the characters "asdfghjkl", and
# the third row consists of the characters "zxcvbnm".
Â 
# Example 1:

# Input: words = ["Hello","Alaska","Dad","Peace"]
# Output: ["Alaska","Dad"]
