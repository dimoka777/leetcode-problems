# You are given a string s consisting only of uppercase English letters.
# You can apply some operations to this string where, in one operation, you can remove any occurrence of one of the substrings "AB" or "CD" from s.

# Return the minimum possible length of the resulting string that you can obtain.

# Note that the string concatenates after removing the substring and could produce new "AB" or "CD" substrings.

 
# Example 1:

# Input: s = "ABFCACDB"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: We can do the following operations:
# - Remove the substring "ABFCACDB", so s = "FCACDB".
# - Remove the substring "FCACDB", so s = "FCAB".
# - Remove the substring "FCAB", so s = "FC".
# So the resulting length of the string is 2.
# It can be shown that it is the minimum length that we can obtain.


class Solution:
    def minLength(self, s: str) -> int:
        stack = []
        for i in s:
            if stack and (stack[-1] == 'A' and i == 'B' or stack[-1] == 'C' and i == 'D'):
                stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(i)
        return len(stack)
