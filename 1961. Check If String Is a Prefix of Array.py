# Given a string s and an array of strings words, determine whether s is a prefix string of words.

# A string s is a prefix string of words if s can be made by concatenating the first k strings in 
words for some positive k no larger than words.length.

# Return true if s is a prefix string of words, or false otherwise.

Â 
# Example 1:

# Input: s = "iloveleetcode", words = ["i","love","leetcode","apples"]
# Output: true
# Explanation:
# s can be made by concatenating "i", "love", and "leetcode" together.

class Solution:
    def isPrefixString(self, s: str, words: List[str]) -> bool:
        res = ''
        for word in words:
            res += word
            if res == s:
                return True

        return False
